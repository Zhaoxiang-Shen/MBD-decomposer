# MBD-decomposer
## Towards pairwise decomposition and surrogate modeling of many-body dispersion
A TensorFlow-based data generator built according to a novel reformulation of many-body dispersion (MBD), which supports pairwise analysis and future ML surrogate modeling. With a given atomic systems, it can output desired components, including:

- Direct pairwise force decomposition of the system
- Eigen-decomposition of the dipole interaction matrix C (used to construct matrix C or matrix B).
- Derivative of matrix C.
  
Please refer to the reference paper for details. A demo on parallel carbon chains is provide.
